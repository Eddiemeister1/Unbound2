# Unbound2
# This is a simple First Person Shooter game made in Unity.
# Using free assets, you are an individual exploring a forest fighting against alien creatures.
# C# is used to implement the UI of the player, the rules of the game, and the behaviours of each character.
# This is still a work in progress.
